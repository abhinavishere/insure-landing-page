## My process
- I started of by building a desktop first markup. Usually i prefer Mobile first but this time i went with desktop first approach. Initially i made the complete structure of website using Semantic HTML5 markup like <main> and <section> tags.

- Then i styles it using SCSS as a preprocessor for CSS file. With the help of CSS Flexbox i was able to achieve the layout.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS For CSS Preprocessors.

### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Focusing on Advanced fluid layouts with grid and flexbox.
- More focus on JavaScript DOM.
